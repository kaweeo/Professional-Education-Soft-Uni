# Description 

The course covers the fundamentals of mapping between a relational database and an object-oriented model (ORM) with a focus on the Django framework. It starts with an introduction to ORM
and its key concepts before moving on to working with models in Django, including defining models, fields, and methods. The course then delves into advanced topics such as migrations, 
Django's admin interface, query operations, model relationships, and inheritance. Students will also learn more complex techniques for working with models and ORM queries in Django. 
The course also covers another popular Python ORM framework, SQLAlchemy, which offers an alternative approach. Throughout the training, exercises will be provided to help participants consolidate
their knowledge at each step. By the end of this course, they will acquire basic skills for building robust, scalable, and efficient database-driven web applications using Python ORM frameworks.
